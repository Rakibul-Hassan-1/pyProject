00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hello everyone, welcome everyone to learn HCIA WLAN Huawei certified wireless LAN engineer online course.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This section mainly introduces the concept of wireless communication, WLAN key technology, 802.11 standard, and WiFi6 technology.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In fact, the most important thing is the working mechanism of WLAN.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What kind of working mechanism is the wireless network, which allows the normal WLAN network to continue working, which is the focus of our lesson.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It can also be said that the focus of the entire HCIA WLAN.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If you can master this course, it means that you have started with WLAN technology, and you can basically understand how WiFi technology runs.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:11,000
After studying this course, you will be able to clarify the basic concepts of wireless communication. It can also distinguish the 802.11 protocol, list the WiFi generation, and explain the highlights of WIFI6, telling the key technologies of WLAN.

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The study of the first section of content is the basic concept of wireless communication.

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The first is wireless radio waves. Everyone must be clear, wifi, or AP, or 3G, 4G, 5G signals, how it transmits it.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In fact, they are transmitted with electromagnetic waves.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic wave. Here we mainly pay attention to how radio waves are transmitted.

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Radio waves are a wave, how does that wave transmit?

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It involves various concepts.

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The first is the wavelength. What is the wavelength of a wave? Is it fixed? If it is not fixed, how can the wavelength be defined?

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The second is the cycle, what is the concept of the cycle?

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:05,000
When it comes to cycles, we also have a word called frequency. Everyone knows that the frequency of various applications to waves is specified.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
For example, in WLAN, our rule is that it has a frequency band for you from 2.4G. It is used for free.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
There are still cycles in that wavelength, how do we define it?

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Another word is the amplitude, what is the amplitude?

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's just that this wave is gentle, or is it steep, right?

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:37,000
This is a radio wave. We use various technologies to change the information or parameters in the radio waves to achieve the purpose of using radio wave transmission data.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
In the specific way, we can make the radio waves that can pass data, and we will see it later.

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
First of all, let's take a look at the frequency and wavelength of radio waves.

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Frequency, high frequency and low frequency, I believe everyone understands.

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
High frequency is for example, both waves are one second, and how many waves can be passed in a second.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
If you pass more, such as the picture on the left, it is high frequency.

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If you pass less, like the picture on the right, it is low frequency.

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That is to say, within the unit time, the number of times or the number of waves that can be completed, we call it frequency.

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The second is the wavelength. In fact, we have a formula. This formula is simple.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
C is equal to λ multiplication with F, C is the speed of light, which is a quantitative, the speed of light cannot change, right?

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So the longer the wavelength, the smaller the frequency is it?

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
If the frequency is larger, is the wavelength smaller?

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
In other words, these two are the opposite relationship.

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We now have a concept of 5G technology called millimeter waves.

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
If the wavelength reaches a degree of millimeter, the frequency may be reduced accordingly.

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What unit is used to express it frequently?

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The unit of frequency is to use Hertz, everyone should pay attention to this.

38
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
For example, 2.4g Hertz, G means 1000, everyone must know.

39
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Let's take a look at the more common frequencies and bands.

40
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
First of all, this is a high frequency γ -ray, right?

41
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What about the small frequency? With wireless radio waves, the frequency band we usually use is here, which is relatively small.

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Others include microwave, infrared rays, ultraviolet rays, etc., in fact, they have a certain frequency.

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Everyone should note that the electromagnetic waves used by WLAN are the radio waves we say.

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let's take a look at which different spectrums are divided into.

45
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You can take a look. We mainly talk about radio waves in this place.

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
WLAN uses the 5G band in it and the 2.4G Hz frequency band.

47
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
We classify it into ultra -high -frequency and high -frequency.

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Like other frequency bands, such as Very High, very high -frequency, high -frequency, their application scenarios are different.

49
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
For example, high -frequency may be applied to civilian radio, and high -frequency is FM broadcast.

50
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We only pay attention to the application scenario of radio waves, that is, the 2.4G Herz band and 5G Hertz frequency band.

51
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Everyone should be clear about this place, all of our frequency bands refer to a frequency range.

52
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It doesn't mean ultra -high frequency, or a certain frequency.

53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Within this frequency range, I divide it as ultra -high frequency.

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
In that range, I divided it into extremely high frequencies.

55
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
WIFI technology uses 2.4g Hz frequency band.

56
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Its frequency range ranges from 2.4g Hertz to 2.4835g Hertz.

57
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
This place must be accurate to the last four in the decimal point.

58
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Because we will involve the problem of channel division later, we will focus on how the frequency range is used.

59
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The second is the 5G Hertz frequency band.

60
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The 5G Herz band is divided into two unconnected frequency bands.

61
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The first frequency band is 5.15g Hertz to 5.35g Hertz.

62
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The second band is from 5.725g Herz to 5.85g Hertz.

63
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
These two frequency bands belong to the frequency band of industry, science and medicine.

64
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,000
ISM frequency bands do not require licenses and fees, as long as they follow a certain launch power.

65
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This transmitting power is generally less than 1 watt, which can cause interference to other frequency bands.

66
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Let's look down.

67
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What is our new concept? It is phase.

68
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The phase is a relative number, which describes the relationship between the two frequency waves.

69
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
In order to measure the phase, the wavelength is divided into 360 copies, each of which is called 1 degree.

70
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We take 0 degrees as the start time of wave spread.

71
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:09,000
If one wave starts to spread at 0 degrees, the other wave begins to spread at 90 degrees,

72
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It is called 90 degrees of different phases.

73
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The spread of waves of the same frequency starts at different times, which will have a great impact on the transmission of electromagnetic waves.

74
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Pay attention to this place, because it is all spread in the air, and it is energy.

75
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
If two wireless signals with the same frequency spread, just at the same time, the phase is the same,

76
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Because the frequency is the same and the signal is the same when it is received, the signal will be relatively enhanced.

77
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:51,000
For example, it was originally a form of A. Now that the two signals are superimposed together, it becomes 2A.

78
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This is the phase enhancement.

79
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
In addition, there is a weakened signal. If a signal is like this,

80
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The other is the opposite, and the difference is 180 degrees, which is equivalent to weakening this signal.

81
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
In the process of equipment development, the corresponding technology should be used to avoid weakening the signal caused by phase.

82
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:22,000
This is some of the specific basic concepts, wavelengths, frequency, phase, and amplitude.

83
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Next, let's take a look at the process of wireless communication.

84
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
First of all, in the process of signal from one end to the other end, the source of the letter is our sending equipment.

85
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Funny is our contact device.

86
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
For example, I want to send a word now, hello world,

87
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The computer is binary. It is not clear that the Hello world you said is.

88
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Therefore, we need a certain measure to change, and we need to take a letter source code.

89
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Convert to a digital signal, first convert it into a digital signal,

90
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Then pass the channel code and modulation to convert it to radio waves and launch.

91
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It is sent to our receiving equipment through channels.

92
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What is the channel? We mentioned the frequency earlier,

93
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
For example, 2.4GHz, the frequency range is quite large, and the signals of various frequencies can go.

94
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's like a road, for example, 20 meters wide. If you don't make a plan,

95
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Everyone will go blindly, and the efficiency will be very low, so we have to divide the lane,

96
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Everyone walks on their own lane, and they will not string to other lanes.

97
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The same is true for channels, for example, I give it a number 1234567,

98
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You can only walk in Channel 1. At this time, it is the concept of the channel.

99
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Divide the frequency into different channels, and send the signal to the receiving device through the channel.

100
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,000
In this process, there are no pipelines in the wireless network, and there are no network cable ports.

101
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So in the wireless, the interface of the receiving signal is called the empty mouth, which is not visible.

102
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Then I will make the information you passed over to a demodulation decoding,

103
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
After the decoding decoding, the receiving device is sent to us. This is a normal wireless communication process.

104
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Let's look at how the encoding is done,

105
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Code is divided into Xinyuan Code and channel coding,

106
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The source code is actually transforming the original signal into a digital signal.

107
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Compress it, by converting text into a digital signal,

108
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Then coded, what is the channel coding?

109
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It is the technology of information correction detection to improve the success rate of channel transmission.

110
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Everyone should be clear about this place,

111
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The introduction of channel coding can restore the maximum degree of recovery information on the receiving device and reduce the code rate.

112
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
For example, many signals will send it to the residence, right?

113
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So how does it come from where each signal comes from?

114
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So we have to do this channel coding to ensure channel transmission,

115
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But in order to effectively transmit the text,

116
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
We have to add a lot of mechanisms here,

117
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
In other words, the channel coding it will bring you a burden,

118
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So the efficiency of transmission will be reduced,

119
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
This is what we call coding technology,

120
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So what is the modulation?

121
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
First of all, our digital signal is like this,

122
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The modulation is to convert the digital signal to wave,

123
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Ordinary sine waves have no information,

124
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And if you want to transmit information, you have to make some changes,

125
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
This is necessary to use the modulation technology,

126
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It is divided into three different ways,

127
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The first is the adjustment,

128
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
For example, it was A,,,

129
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's 0 signal,

130
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
When I want to express 1,

131
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Change to 2A,

132
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Just parsing,

133
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
This is also the process of analysis later,

134
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
This is the adjustment,

135
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What is FM?

136
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Very simple,

137
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That is the normal frequency,

138
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
When I want to change, I will slow down the frequency,

139
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Or increase the frequency,

140
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Originally a cycle can only pass one wave,

141
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Two waves are passed now,

142
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
This place has a message conveyed,

143
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So this purpose of transmitting the signal by adjusting the frequency,

144
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This is the frequency adjustment,

145
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The last one is the appearance,

146
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What is the appearance? At different nodes,

147
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Maybe the phase is different,

148
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Maybe this place is a normal phase,

149
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
When adjusting,

150
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I will give it a 180 degree adjustment,

151
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
This can also convey the information you want to transmit,

152
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
We are through these three modulation methods,

153
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Pass the signal to the opposite end,

154
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
If you accept information,

155
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You need to analyze the frequency zone signal into a digital signal,

156
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Analysis into 0101 form,

157
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The digital signal is decoded, and

158
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
